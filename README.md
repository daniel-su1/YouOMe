# YouOMe CRUD API

## Project Description
YouOMe is a Java-based web application using Spring Boot, designed to help users keep track of money owed to them by their friends. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) friend entries along with the amount owed.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot, which simplifies the development of stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications.
- **Data Access**: Spring Data JPA for database interactions, providing a layer of abstraction over Java Persistence API (JPA).
- **Database**: MySQL or any other relational database (configurable in `application.properties`).
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML forms for user input (`friend-form.html`) and display (`list-friends.html`), indicating a straightforward, user-friendly interface.
- **Build Tool**: Maven for managing project dependencies and building the application.
- **Version Control**: Assumed to be managed with Git (not specified in the files but commonly used in such projects).
